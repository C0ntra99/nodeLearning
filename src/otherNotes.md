## Other Node.js notes

### npm 
- used to handle packages that are installed
- ```npm install {package}``` will install the package globaly for anyone to use
- ```npm init -y``` will initialize a project along with a package.json to handle packages for that project
    - Once in the project folder, install packages using ```npm i --save {package}``` in order to only install them for the project
